## Projects & Portfolio

### Data Science & Machine Learning
[Turnaround Analysis For Airlines](https://github.com/raoliveirads/turnaround-project)
<p align="justify">
Turnaround is one of the most critical processes in airport operations, as it directly affects the efficiency, punctuality, and profitability of airlines. This term refers to the time required for an aircraft to complete all ground activities between landing and the next takeoff. The faster and more efficient this process is, the lower the operational costs and the greater the airport’s capacity to handle a higher volume of flights. Optimizing turnaround reduces delays, improves punctuality, and increases operational efficiency, positively impacting the reputation of both airlines and airports. Moreover, a well-managed turnaround enables better fleet utilization, contributing to the sustainability of the aviation sector.

### Data Analytics & Power BI
**Spend Analysis**

<p align="justify">
This Power BI project delivered an interactive expense analysis dashboard that provides consolidated visibility into company spending, which is essential for large multinational organizations to control costs, monitor key financial indicators, and support data-driven decisions across multiple regions and cost centers. By centralizing data and enabling real-time monitoring of expenses and performance, the solution helped identify inefficiencies and optimization opportunities, resulting in a return on investment (ROI) of approximately 18% within the first year.

**Satisfaction Survey Analysis**

<p align="justify">
This Power BI project delivered an interactive satisfaction survey dashboard designed to analyze feedback from students, faculty, and staff, supporting a university during its expansion across Brazil. Consolidating survey data into a single analytical view enabled leadership to monitor key satisfaction indicators, compare results across campuses and regions, and identify critical improvement opportunities. By providing timely insights into academic quality, infrastructure, and student experience, the solution supported more informed strategic decisions and continuous improvement initiatives, resulting in a return on investment (ROI) of approximately 15% within the first year through improved retention, engagement, and operational efficiency.
