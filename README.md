## Projects & Portfolio
[Turnaround Analysis For Airlines](https://github.com/raoliveirads/turnaround-project)
Turnaround is one of the most critical processes in airport operations, as it directly affects the efficiency, punctuality, and profitability of airlines. This term refers to the time required for an aircraft to complete all ground activities between landing and the next takeoff. The faster and more efficient this process is, the lower the operational costs and the greater the airport’s capacity to handle a higher volume of flights. Optimizing turnaround reduces delays, improves punctuality, and increases operational efficiency, positively impacting the reputation of both airlines and airports. Moreover, a well-managed turnaround enables better fleet utilization, contributing to the sustainability of the aviation sector.
